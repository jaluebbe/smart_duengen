Shahid - We need to know what all feature does this library provide
1. Converting the Shape file to Geoson.
What other features does the library provide? 

This code is not being run on mobile. The javascript code needs to be accessed via a webbrowser internally. 
We may face issue while submission of the application as application with javascript libraries are rejected sometimes.
Hence need to understand what are the other outputs/features that the library extracts.
